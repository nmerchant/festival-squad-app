# Festival Squad - iOS & Android App

## Installation

```
$ npm install
$ cd ios && pod install
```

## Run on iOS

This should auto-launch an iPhone X emulator (keyword should).

```
$ react-native run-ios
```


## Run on Android

This requires an Android Emulator to already be running.

* Create a new device in Android Studio > AVD Manager
* Name it something simple, I chose `pixel2`

The device should now be able to be run manually from AVD Manager or from the Terminal with `emulator @pixel2`

```
$ react-native run-android
```
